        Beryl Cook is one of Britain’s most talented and amusing artists
        .Beryl’s pictures feature women of all shapes and sizes enjoying
        themselves .Born between the two world wars, Beryl Cook eventually left
        Kendrick School in Reading at the age of 15, where she went to
        secretarial school and then into an insurance office. After moving to
        London and then Hampton, she eventually married her next door neighbour
        from Reading, John Cook. He was an officer in the Merchant Navy and
        after he left the sea in 1956, they bought a pub for a year before John
        took a job in Southern Rhodesia with a motor company. Beryl bought their
        young son a box of watercolours, and when showing him how to use it, she
        decided that she herself quite enjoyed painting. John subsequently
        bought her a child’s painting set for her birthday and it was with this
        that she produced her first significant work, a half-length portrait of
        a dark-skinned lady with a vacant expression and large drooping breasts.
        It was aptly named ‘Hangover’ by Beryl’s husband and It is often
        frustrating to attempt to plan meals that are designed for one. Despite
        this fact, we are seeing more and more recipe books and Internet
        websites that are dedicated to the act of cooking for one. Divorce and
        the death of spouses or grown children leaving for college are all
        reasons that someone accustomed to cooking for more than one would
        suddenly need to learn how to adjust all the cooking practices utilized
        before into a streamlined plan of cooking that is more efficient for one
        person creating less
